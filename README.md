A Django email backend for Azure Communication Email service.


## Installation
Run the following on your system:

    pip install django-azure-communication-email

Then, add these settings to your Django `settings.py`:

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_azure_communication_email.EmailBackend'

    AZURE_COMMUNICATION_CONNECTION_STRING = '...'
    # OR
    AZURE_KEY_CREDENTIAL = '...'
    AZURE_COMMUNICATION_ENDPOINT = '...'

If you prefer to use Azure Active Directory authentication, you can use the
following `settings.py` instead:

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_azure_communication_email.EmailBackend'
    
    AZURE_COMMUNICATION_ENDPOINT = '...'
    
    # Note: make sure to set the following environment variables:
    # AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

Now, when you use `django.core.mail.send_mail`, Azure Communication Email
service will send the messages by default.

## Disabling Retry Policy

By default, the Azure SDK will retry failed requests.
This can cause blocking issues when rate limits are hit, as workers may wait
for extended periods (an hour or more) trying to send emails.

To disable retries and fail immediately when rate limits are reached, add this
setting:

    AZURE_COMMUNICATION_RETRY_POLICY = 'no_retries'

This will cause the EmailClient to raise an `HttpResponseError` immediately if
the rate limit has been hit, preventing your application from becoming
unresponsive due to blocked workers.

## Running Tests
To run the tests::

    python runtests.py

If you want to debug the tests, just add this file as a python script to your IDE run configuration.

## Creating a Release

To create a release:

* Run `poetry version {patch|minor|major}` as explained in [the docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version).
  This will update the version in `pyproject.toml`.
* Commit that change and use git to tag that commit with a version that matches the pattern `v*.*.*`.
* Push the tag and the commit (note some IDEs don't push tags by default).
